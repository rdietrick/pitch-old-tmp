TRIGGERS
======================
1. Must be created by root (or someone with a permission which pitch doesn't have, apparently).
2. Can be viewes with this query:
SELECT TRIGGER_NAME, EVENT_MANIPULATION, EVENT_OBJECT_TABLE, ACTION_STATEMENT 
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TRIGGERS 
    WHERE TRIGGER_SCHEMA='pitch_db2';
